i wanted to show in this project that i can find the code with
the concepts you needed(hint the name of the package)and adapt 
to it which is kinda new to me because i worked on a less concept apps code complexity wise
in a few hours i think all the points that you asked in the interview is in here 
i learn fast and adapt fast i just didn't write code android in 7 months that's why i wanted to join your
company so i can specialise in my field and always keep up with it 
how i work is finding projects with the concepts that i need because its faster and i can learn a lot
from seeing different code
